                Group therapy is a type of psychotherapy where a group of individuals facing similar psychological challenges come together to work under the guidance of professionals in a safe therapeutic environment. Group therapy allows participants to connect with others going through similar experiences in a safe setting, fostering a sense of security, mutual support, and understanding.

                Group psychotherapy is for individuals experiencing the same psychological distress or symptoms, such as anxiety, loss, burnout, and other challenges. Group therapy is suitable for those seeking to improve their mental health or achieve psychological balance through group interaction and support. Participants are selected based on how well their needs align with the session's objectives.

                Individual therapy focuses on direct interaction between the client and therapist to address personal issues. Group therapy, on the other hand, focuses on interaction among a group of individuals facing similar challenges. This reduces feelings of isolation and promotes healing through shared experiences, mutual support, and learning from others.

Each session focuses on specific topics, such as anxiety, depression, loss, and relationships.

We encourage participants to interact and share personal experiences, which fosters healing and collective growth. Sessions typically range from 6 to 8, depending on the group psychotherapy topic.
